===========================

This project is a fork of [unprocess](https://github.com/reilandeubank/unprocess) which is a
simple, open source solution to taking unprocessed images on your Android phone, free of
modern devices' excessive computational photography.

I'm considering whether to invest time in development, but there are no guarantees.
